# Unique-Password-Generator
When a user passes it certain criteria (i.e. length and character types), the password generator creates a unique and strong password between 8-128 characters long.  This is a tool that provides user with greater security when creating new logins.

## Description
In this project, I have created a unique password generator.  This generator takes in information from the user including how long they want the password to be and what types of characters they want included in this password. One cool part of this computer generator is that every time it generates a new password it runs a check to ensure that the password includes at least one of each character type criteria submitted by the user.  

## Installation
NA

## Usage
Employees(or people in general) can use this generator to create a unique password for each account they have. This provides great security.  A unique password for every account prevents hackers from accessing multiple accounts where you use the same password.
